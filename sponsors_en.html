        <!-- Page Information -->
        <p style="text-align:left">
        Thank you for being interested on sponsoring my videos. As you can see, this site is 100% public and can be seen by companies and my followers.<br><br>

        This site enumerates some important points about the way I work with sponsors:<br><br>

        • My sponsored videos do not have pre-roll or mid-roll advertisements enabled.<br>
        • I don't make full dedicated videos to products or services, only integrations (30-60 seconds segments where I talk about your product or service)<br>
        • My content is my own. I create and produce each video based on what I’m excited about and what I think will be relevant/helpful to my audience at the time. The topic of the video is not negotiable, I also don't give the topic of the video before hand.<br>
        • I do not submit previews of full videos to anyone for approval or revisions. Although I do share previews of the sponsored segment if desired.<br>
        • I don't advertise crypto or NFT related products.<br>
        * I don't advertise <a href="https://twitter.com/pablokbs/status/1642186175262732291">VPN solutions or products</a>.<br>
        * I usually don't advertise webhosting products or services. This is because my followers should be able to setup their own servers and I'd always recommend that over paying for webhosting.<br>
        • I do not guarantee any number of views or any amount of audience engagement on any videos. While I want every video to do well, there are too many variables beyond my control for me to make any claims regarding potential viewership.<br>

        Thank you for taking the time to read and understand my Ethics Statement. This probably doesn’t cover every possible scenario under the sun, but it should give you a pretty solid idea of how highly I value the integrity behind what I do and the relationship I’ve built with my community.<br><br>

        As always, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via <a href="mailto:pablo@peladonerd.com">email</a><br><br>

        - Pablo
